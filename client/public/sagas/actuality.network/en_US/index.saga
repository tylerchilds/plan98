Now, if you're curious how the free version works, you're in luck. Underneath the layers of code are my digital twins in shells.

Think Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but Donatello specifically for my vibe.

Meet Shelly.

Try typing: echo $0

This invoked a command in the path of the computer named "echo", like an Amazon Echo Dot (not affiliated).

Whatever follows the echo command will be reverberated back to the echoed.

The dollar sign ($) is a symbol to indicate the string of symbols are a variable name. Historically, the zero (0) variable is used to locate the first program to be run on the computer.

The echo of $0 will shout back the command of the current program-- the first one after turning on the computer.

This computer runs the bash program after the init sequence-- the same program you are running inside of now!

What do I mean by that?

Well, if we've done everything correct, I mean exactly the following.

Your echo said bash.

That echo ran in a silly computer simulation on the sillyz.computer simulation on your device with the network providing the source via the author's backpack that is a hybrid reality bootstrapping system that also runs on bash, or for that level of data recovery from the code vault in the arctic Svalbard archipelago where it is stored, sh.

That was your echo. You called to the void and the void returned from your digital twin. The Black Mirror.

I might not look like it could be a me a Mario, but I'm a plumber and my best friend and most ardent competition is Sonic the Hedgehog. Anyway, I think you're the type of person that appreciates the extra attention to detail that comes with a little time and a little effort from your internet service provider and we've got Steamboat Willie working around the clock for us now that he's sprung.

I'm not saying you live in a simulation, but if you're experiencing this, you've generally had a disregard for the animated reality. Generally, we've been seeing this as not cool, and if you want to continue to hang around here, you'll need to accept that we all are connected to the narrative-- which, is hanging together by a thread, no thanks to you.

SULLY, a computer whiz, is talking to someone on a flip phone.

@ Sully
> Hello and Welcome!

Sully puts the flip phone into the top right pocket of his jacket.

@ Sully
> TheLanding.Page is a board for surfing the digital airwaves.

Sully stands up, shrugs, and points downwards.

@ Sully
> Scroll down for more information. Oh wait...

BARBARA BILLIARDS, a pool shark, turns around, revealing herself.

@ Barbara Billiards
> Hah. Still peddling your silly little wares?

@ Sully
> They're not silly, you're silly, but yes, I am and I'm also silly too.

@ Barbara Billiards
> None of that rhymed.

@ Sully
> I'm still working on my writing.

@ Barbara Billiards
> You'll be a worthy opponent one day, Sillonious. For now, you're pathetic.

Barbara leaves, knocking over racks of comics, CDs, DVDs, Records, FLOPPY DISKS.

@ Sully
> We don't like her, do we Wally?

WALLY, a dachshund chihuahua mix, wakes up from a nap and huffs at the torrent of media.

@ Sully
> Huh. I forgot we had these.

Sully picks up an old FLOPPY DISK labeled "CyberDunk 1998."

@ Sully
> You know Wally, they said this game was a Jumanji.

Wally whimpers and lays down.

@ Sully
> Don't worry, I'm not going to play it. This is a high-fantasy San Fransokyo basketball JRPG. Not my genre, so I know I wouldn't survive the afformentioned Jumanji elements.

Wally gets up and rushes out of the room.

@ Sully
> Should probably figure out where to securely store this because it would be a literal nightmare if Barbara had this copy.

Sally, a cyberpunk-rockstar, walks in.

@ Sally
> I don't understand why you spend any time worrying what any other comics think.

@ Sully
> I didn't even say anything.

Sully, slightly caught off guard places CYBERDUNK 1998 on the countertop.

@ Sally
> Your face says it all, you're frazzled.

@ Sully
> It is just--

@ Sally
> And look, everything is knocked over-- Barbara was here.

@ Sully
> I don't know what her beef with me is.

@ Sally
> Ha! I knew it.

@ Sully
> I don't even like performing, I just can't control it sometimes.

@ Sally
> I can give you writing lessons if you want.

@ Sully
> I know how to write.

@ Sally
> But you don't act like it and that's the difference between you and Barbara.

@ Sully
> She's not my nemesis.

@ Sally
> Nobody else gets in your head. Nobody else flips the narrative on you, either.

@ Sully
> Whatever, can you help me pick this up?

@ Sally
> I'll need to go in a few, but sure.

Sol, a dancing blur in a yellow hat, walks in.

@ Sol
> Hey Sully! I've got a bunch of wares in my trunk, can you give me a hand?

@ Sully
> Sure thing!
& mouths to Sally
> Be right back

Sully and Sol skip out of the shop as Sally notices the floppy disks.

@ Sally
> I didn't realize he still had these.

Sally quickly sorts the floppy disks into their case as his WATCH ALARM beeps.

@ Sally
> Shoot, gotta go, sorry Sully.

Sally places the FLOPPY DISK CASE on the counter next to CYBERDUNK 1998.

@ Sally
> Oh whoa! I'll bring this back later Sully.

Sally swipes CYBERDUNK 1998 as he vanishes into the maze of media.

Sol and Sully return carrying boxes and boxes each.

@ Sully
> Where'd you find all this?

They place the boxes on the counter. Sully touches the FLOPPY DISK CASE.

@ Sully
& mouthes
> Thanks Sally.

Sully's WATCH pulses a quick blue and Sully smiles.

@ Sol
> When! It was a fire sale.

@ Sully
> Oh whoa, snagged them for free the moment the would have been destroyed?

@ Sol
> Yup! I didn't get everything. Didn't even scratch the surface. This place was bigger than the Library of Alexandria before it.

@ Sully
> Before everyone retained the legal rights to the backup copies in the event of a natural disaster or otherwise?

@ Sol
> That.

@ Sully
> Tragic. Anyways, shall we?

The two take the new media and with that, they disappear into the maze.
