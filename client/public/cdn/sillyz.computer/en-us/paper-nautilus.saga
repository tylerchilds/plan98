! Opening Image (1% of the script): This is the first impression of what kind of story the audience is about to see. It's a snapshot of the main character's problem before the adventure begins.

# Hospital

A sterile, empty room with only a heart rate monitor plugged into a spinning globe.

@ Heart Rate Monitor
> Beep, boop. Beep, Boop.

The black screen has an orange glow as the lines moves from highs to lows with each beep boop.

@ Heart Rate Monitor
> Buzzzzzzz

The globe halts to a stop, the monitor line is flat.

^ Fade to black

a beat

^ Fade to gray

# Gray Void

A slash.

A tiny corner of paper cuts through the gray, creating a vacuum that sucks the gray back into hyper space.

# Hyper Space

Stars blur as streaks, moving faster, ever faster, a carousel of colors.

@ Wally (V.O.)
> Another final hour is at hand.

^ Fade to green then blue

# Computer Room - 1970

SALLY enters the COMPUTER, a ROOM where each wall holds components in the system.

@ Sally
& to herself
> Decaf coffee. Decaf? Decaf. No caffeine. What's the point.

SALLY places the coffee on her desk, next to stacks and stacks of cards.

@ SALLY
> Weird. You weren't here when I left?

The top stack of cards are aged, faded, worn, compared to the other stacks.

@ SALLY
> What do you have to say?

The cards whir into the machine as SALLY feeds them to it.

@ SALLY
> HAH! I knew something was off.

Rushing out the door, SALLY vanishes with a blue flash

^ Fade from blue to orange.

# Band Room - 1998 - Silly

# Lecture Hall - 2012 - Sol

SOL sits in the middle seat in the middle row of a full lecture hall.

@ Sol
& whispers to self
> What?

A notification on SOL's LAPTOP reads, "New Disc Inserted"

@ Sol
> How?

Sol presses eject and ejects a disc, looking around. Everyone stares into their screens.

@ Sol
> Where did you come from?

Sol re-inserts the disc, plugs in headphones, and smashes play.

@ Sol
> Excuse me

Sol quickly, awkwardly, apologetically stumbles out of the row and the hall before vanishing.
