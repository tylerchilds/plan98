# The Paper Nautilus Umbrella - The Flying Disk Operating System (Patent Pending)

In a void, a paper in the breeze.

By chance, the page landed face down and I crawled out the back.

Pencil out from behind my ear, I picked the paper up, and I began to draw.

I drew some squares on the front and then I shook them out from where I crawled.

To seal those smaller notes, I licked each back and left them front and front.

Now on one note I wrote and wrote in my native tongue 'en-us'.

I said, "Hello Good Friend, I hope this message finds you well. I've landed safe in who knows where, but every thing is fine. I'll send for you the moment I've arrived." and then I signed it "Ty".

And then I peeled the page apart, with every language far and wide a stack a mile high.

Then one by one, I took each down and then I spun around.

I flung each note and out it went to the proper home.

Once everyone had heard from me, it was time to start the next surprise.

# The Circus

Beat for beat the DRUMMER drums upon a box cajon in the center ring.

@ Drummer
> 1, 2, 3, 4

He hits the drum, one, two, three, four

@ Drummer
> Count with me

He drums four times again

@ Drummer
> Mix them up!

His pattern incorporates alternating between the middle and the top

@ Drummer
> 1, 2, 3, 4

The drummer then begins to freestyle, "The usual" as Tommi called it.

@ Drummer
> Swing with this, bass on 3 and 8!

The UMBRELLA MAN enters the RING

@ Umbrella Man
> Ladies, gentlemen, we's, they's, us's, clowns, and fleas!

The FLEA CIRCUS cheers.

@ Umbrella Man
> The moment you'e all been waiting for, may I present to you!

The JESTER enters the RING, juggling of course

@ Umbrella Man
> The Juggling Jester!

The umbrella man leaves the ring, with the drummer and the jester performing in tandum.

! DIRECTORS NOTE: For production, we will have the juggler perform first and then we'll have the drummer perform the folly work in front of a green screen. 

! PRODUCER'S NOTE: Pull the drummer from the ring to significantly save on post production costs.

The Jester's routine cycles through drawing the imaginary box.

@ Jester
> This ball will triumph over gravity, for fleeting moments.

From corner to corner, the jester catches one ball tossing across the x-axis and up diagonally, but always letting gravity follow along the y-axis.

@ Jester
> Make note, this is one ball now, but all more are is time.

The Jester incorporates a second ball.

@ Jester
> Watch how this one chases that, around and round they go. Something's missing?

The Jester incorporates the third ball.

@ Jester 
> Ah, there we go, a three core architecture. Perfectly balanced, symmetrical, performant.

# The Soapbox

The MAGICIAN lowers THE CIRCUS card for the audience

@ Magician
> The Circus is but one place, and the Jester, the Drummer, and the Umbrella man are but three dolls on a stage.

The MAGICIAN reveals the FLEA CIRCUS card

@ Magician
> The Umbrella Man

A flea tight rope walks upside down with an umbrella

@ Magician
> The Drummer

A flea in a harness pulls a carriage

@ Magician
> The Jester

A flea laying back, rolls a ball with all limbs

@ Magician
> The real magic is not what these fleas are capable of, but what you are capable of

The magician slides a double blank from his blank deck.

@ Magician
> Where would you go if you could go anywhere?

The magician throws a card the camera.

# Behind the Scenes

The PRODUCER begins to wrap up the cameras and pack the bags

@ Producer
> I hope you enjoyed the show tonight.

The producer reaches out with a NOTE with an CODE to a location in memory

@ Producer
> There's a bit of post-production first, but take this FLYING DISK OPERATING SYSTEM

The producer vanishes the moment the paper leaves his hand.

@ Producer (V.O.)
> Was I ever here at all?

# Behind the Curtain

A red curtain

@ Voice Behind the Curtain
> I would like to take you on an adventure.

The curtain ruffles as it speaks.

@ Voice Behind the Curtain
> So far we've learned how to draw new ideas on paper. We've learned how to read and write and send our stories out to be translated and told by untold contemporary and future generations.

The curtain turns blue

@ Voice Behind the Curtain
> I am proud of you. You've achieved so much in what started as just a simple little magic show.

The curtain turns purple

@ Voice Behind the Curtain
> And you also got your typing speed to be super fast!

The curtain turns green

@ Voice Behind the Curtain
> And your confident in your own voice now

The curtain turns orange

@ Voice Behind the Curtain
> And you stayed entirely silly

^ Curtain fades to yellow and out

! Editor's Note: Move the title page to the front

! Writer's Note: We tried that and everyone was "afraid to look at code"

! Engineer's Note: That's not even code

! Manager's Note: That's not helpful or productive to the problem

! Architect's Note: Technically it is code anyways

! Director's Note: I'm cutting this for the edit, but saving the conversation for archival

# Lecture Hall

The PROFESSOR uses a remote from behind a LECTURN

@ Professor
> The screenplay is the simplest universal construct binding reality.

The Professor moves to the next slide.

@ Professor
> In the beginning there was no communication, but cave paintings eventually became computer code.

The professor shows pairs of G-C and A-T in DNA Helix form disassembling into ones and zeros.

@ Professor
> With computers, we needed to sort our text into code, documents, spreadsheets, what have you.

The cave returns and then transforms into a computer as a room, then a computer as a chair, then a computer as a desk, a laptop, a flip phone, a smart phone, a watch, sunglasses, headphones.

@ Professor
> The conclusion was mapping our senses directly onto the machine.

The professor shows a slide with all different screens and sizes and colors.

@ Professor
> Sight. Visuals. Shapes. Sizes. Colors.

The next slide goes black, but the bass surprises the audience

@ Professor
> Sound. Aurals. Waves. Frequencies. Color Space.

The professor farts. The class laughs.

@ Professor
> Smells. Nostrils. Nose.

## Why a built as a JavaScript Operating System?

Building for distributed-systems historically has relied on cross-platform architectures and compilation.

People that build and buy digital goods do not like or care about any of those words, but pay to save time and money.

Whether you're dabbling with technology for the first time or shipping international enterprise products, same, same.

### Portable.

Whether you're flash drive hopping, dual booting, or embedding, the architecture is flexible.

Start from scratch

### Consistent.

Leveraging modern approaches, all existing web content is backwards compatible.

Start right now

### Customizable.

Match your phone with your slides every costume change, for every performance and pitch.

Change theme

### Innovative.

Five action words connect script to screen, pitch to play in a module: learn to draw in style when you teach.

Create a scene

### Compatible.

Populate windows with any networked data source or be offline and local only.

Go Enterprise or Community

### Collapsible.

In the event of computing collapse, the source code serves as a contract with our new overlords, should we be able to negotiate.

Print Source Code Now

## From Scratch

First, we need to create a new computer with a literal and metaphorical thumb drive.

Unless you already have a folder named `thumb-drive` in your home directory, rust+cargo, and deno installed, run:

```
deno task provision
```

Then, we're ready to start the services.

```
deno task start
```

That's it.

## There is more though

Check out deno.json to modify under the hood or maybe mod.js to be in the driver seat for climate control.

These internals do assume there are corresponding ssh user keys for the reverse services to bind correctly.

### Default Boot Services

These are the default services at boot:

```
start-client
start-server
```

To start the web server, sandboxed by deno, run:
```
deno task start-client
```

To start a private 9p server for the source code of the web server, run:
```
deno task start-server
```

### Optional Boot Services

```
reverse-client
reverse-server
```
To serve public dns traffic on the newly started web server, run:
```
deno task reverse-client
```

To serve the private 9p server over public dns, run:
```
deno task reverse-server
```

### You mentioned hardware?

To serve a metaphorical thumb drive named literal thumb-drive that should virtually mount where your physical thumb drives mount in your digital file system module, run:

```
deno task thumb-drive
```

Any hardware capable of running the light-weight 9p utilities will be able to access the onboard 9p system or any 9p compliant peer in the network.

To unplug the drive, run `deno task unthumb-drive`.

## Unified Prototyping, Development and Deployment

Run:

```
deno task start
```

And if that sounds like a problem waiting to happen when it comes to debugging, you're right.

In that scenario, [https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/debugging_your_code](learn a little about debugging), then run run:

```
deno task debug-client
```
